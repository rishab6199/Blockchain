This project allows users to perform transactions of either crypto assets or conventional money transaction using blockchain. For transactions of crypto assets we employ Ganache which is a Crypto blockchain and Metamask Wallet for validation.

Metamask - MetaMask is the leading self-custodial wallet. The safe and simple way to access blockchain applications and web3. Trusted by millions of users worldwide.
Metamask serves as a validation for these transactions.
